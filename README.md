# SnakeGame-java

## Description:
Developed an interactive Snake game in Java using Swing, featuring real-time scoring, keyboard controls, and manual restart via spacebar, demonstrating strong GUI programming and game logic skills.

## Gameplay

- **Snake Movement:**
  - The snake automatically moves in the direction it is facing.
  - Use arrow keys to change the direction of the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).

- **Eating Food:**
  - The snake can eat the food represented by an enemy icon.
  - Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player earns points.

- **Game Over:**
  - The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.
  - To restart the game, press the `SPACEBAR`.

## Controls

- Arrow keys:
  - `UP`: Move the snake upward.
  - `DOWN`: Move the snake downward.
